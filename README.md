creating a mqtt protocol just for fun in c.....not sure if that is best idea but I don't know let's see..


-
What we are going to be requiring to build a MQTT protocol
-


**we need a place or a protocol through which clients are going to connect to us in other words maybe a tcp connection? not sure will need to look into some networking conecpts** 
**the tcp connection is going to enable for the other clients to connect to us**

-- accept a tcp handshake first
-- manage packets
-- manage those connections?
-- manage all the connected people
-- create a place for them to create rooms.
-- rooms will have the ability to subscribe 
-- subscribed connection will receive the data that is being propogated in the room? not sure if that sounds fully correct but it is what it is...
-- manage deconnections
-- throw data in a timely manner since this is going to be somewhat of my own personal use case for a mqtt I want it to throw some data (I wanna test a mqtt backend that I have created with the populated data)
-- transfer of packets definitely how is this gonna work? I have no fk*** idea xD
-- is this going to be a broker?
-- backpressure management and memory management also


--------------------------------------------------


-- so some networking concepts we'll have to understand like the ipv4 and ipv6 mechanism, it basically is needed to build up a system of your own particular requirements
    there is also a byte order scenario where if we are accepting a particular packet we'll have to "Basically, youâ€™ll want to convert the numbers to Network Byte Order before they go out on the wire, and convert them to Host Byte Order as they come in off the wire."

-- struct addrinfo --> we will be loading this struct up a bit and call getaddrifno, it will basically give us a pointer to a linked list of these structures

-- initialize a addrinfo


----------------------------------------------
how packets in the mqtt library are generally working 

so there is a uint_8t buf, it is being passed in the receive call with void so that it can be manipulated accordingly, the values change depending on the buffer that is being processed

--- **packet shifting** ---
Right shift: When the info you want is in the most significant bits of a byte (like packet type), so you bring them down to the low end.

Left shift: When building a multi-byte number from least significant to most significant parts, you shift new chunks up to their correct place.
